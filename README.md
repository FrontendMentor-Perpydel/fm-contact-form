## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) (Built on top of TailwindCSS) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I was able to implement the useReducer hook for the first time without major issues with a simple project.So I can go on to implement it in a larger project, and then later implement it when using React Redux or Redux Toolkit.

I was also able to implement the DaisyUI built on top of TailwindCSS styling for more sophisticated styling and majorly using the different beautiful themes.
could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
